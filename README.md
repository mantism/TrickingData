# Tricking Survey 2016

This is an ongoing project using ES6, React, d3, and SASS. In 2016, I sent out a survey to the tricking community on
facebook and built a website using d3, html, and css. After working over the summer and gaining experience with more
modern web technologies I have been working on redoing the site with an improved design and experience.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
